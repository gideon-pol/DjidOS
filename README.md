## About
This is a 64-bit higher half kernel programmed in C++. It is build using Multiboot2. It has a working terminal, a keyboard driver, a mouse driver and uses a framebuffer to draw to the screen. This is a hobby project worked on only by me, so this kernel is still lacking many features I plan on adding in the future.
